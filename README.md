# FaceLink Project 
About:

Requirements and Installation:
You must have OpenCV installed on your system, as well the latest version of Node. Then, you must install all of the required modules. This is done by the following command:

npm install

How to Execute
Run the server before connecting to http://127.0.0.1:8081/index.html within a web browser. While within the directory, type the following line to start the server:
[-] `node app.js`
[-] For the server, press Control+C to stop the server and end the process. You can access the web-app by connecting to http://127.0.0.1:8081/index.html. This does require a webcam to work.

Module content - WM245-Programming-Languages-for-Cyber-Security:
Programming languages are the medium through which programmers precisely describe concepts, formulate algorithms, and reason about solutions. In the course of a career, a cyber professional may work with many different languages, separately or together. If developing software, they must understand the programming models underlying different languages and make informed design choices in languages supporting multiple complementary approaches. The cyber professional is likely to need to learn new languages and programming constructs. They therefore must understand the principles underlying how programming language features are defined, composed, and implemented. The effective use of programming languages, and appreciation of their limitations, also requires a basic knowledge of programming language translation and static program analysis, as well as run-time components such as memory management.

This module enables students to develop insight into the significant differences between different programming paradigms. Object oriented programming, functional programming and event driven programming are given special emphasis. Students develop solutions under these different paradigms to embed theoretical concepts into professional practice.
